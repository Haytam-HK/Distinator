The project involves creating a minimalist version of the Paint software, where users can draw on a blank canvas using basic tools such as a pencil, eraser, and color picker. The application will allow simple functionalities like selecting brush size, changing colors, and saving the artwork. The goal is to develop a lightweight, user-friendly drawing tool, focusing on ease of use and minimalistic design, making it accessible for basic drawing tasks.![1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29ede971-4f63-4c3a-9144-efd1bd327fe8)
